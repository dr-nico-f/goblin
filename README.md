# Goblin 🧙‍♂️  
**Automated Job Discovery Bot**

Goblin fetches new remote job listings, filters and ranks them by your criteria, and posts the best matches directly to Slack.  
Built with **Python 3.10+**, **AWS**, and the **Slack API**.

---

## 💡 Why I Built This
I got tired of manually checking job boards every day, scanning the same listings, and losing track of what I'd already seen.
So I built a bot to do it for me — fetch listings, filter out the noise, rank what's left, and drop the best matches into Slack where I'd actually see them.

To be clear: Goblin is a **discovery** tool, not an application tool. It surfaces relevant listings so I can review them and apply personally — it doesn't generate or submit applications.

It started as a quick script and grew into a full serverless pipeline once I realized other people wanted their own filters too.
Now it runs on a schedule, supports multiple profiles, and is fully controllable from Slack.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone and create a virtual environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dr-nico-f/goblin.git
cd goblin
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Optional)* Install the package in editable mode so you can skip setting `PYTHONPATH` for every command:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Environment variables  
Create a file named `.env` in the project root:
```
GOBLIN_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-bot-token
GOBLIN_SLACK_CHANNEL=C0123456789
```

*(Keep this file private — it’s already ignored by `.gitignore`.)*

## 🧠 Usage

### Slack slash command handler
Deploy `goblin.slack_events.lambda_handler` behind an HTTPS endpoint (e.g., API Gateway) configured as a Slack Slash Command request URL.  
Env vars required: `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `GOBLIN_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (for posting elsewhere).  
Commands (extendable in `src/goblin/commands.py`):
- `help`
- `status [--profile nick]`
- `filters salary [--profile nick]`
- `filters show [--profile nick]`
- `filters set salary <min> [--allow-missing true|false] [--profile nick]`
- `ranking show [--profile nick]`
- `ranking set <weight> <value> [--profile nick]`
- `profiles list`
- `sources list`
- `sources set <source> (enabled|query|category|limit) <value>`
- `run [--profile nick] [--source remotive] [--limit N]`
- `run --preview` (dry-run; no Slack post, prints top matches)
- `schedule show|set` (backed by EventBridge via `GOBLIN_SCHEDULE_RULE`)
- Profiles can auto-resolve from Slack: `user_map` / `channel_map` in `configs/profiles.yaml` map Slack IDs to profile names; `--profile` overrides.

### Slack usage guide
- Invite the bot to your channel: `/invite @Goblin`
- Run commands with the slash command (e.g., `/goblin help`, `/goblin status`)
- Profile defaults can come from Slack user/channel (`user_map` / `channel_map`), but you can override with `--profile <name>`
- For edits:
  - Filters: `/goblin filters show --profile nick`, `/goblin filters set salary 150000 --allow-missing false --profile nick`
  - Ranking: `/goblin ranking show --profile nick`, `/goblin ranking set keyword_hit 1.2 --profile nick`
  - Sources: `/goblin sources list`, `/goblin sources set remotive limit 5`
  - Schedule: `/goblin schedule show --profile nick`, `/goblin schedule set "cron(0 14 * * ? *)" --profile nick`
  - Run: `/goblin run --preview --profile nick --source remotive --limit 3`

### Dry run (no Slack post)
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src python -m goblin.cli find --source remotive --dry-run
```

### Real run (posts to Slack)
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src python -m goblin.cli find --source remotive
```

### Health check
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src python -m goblin.cli test
```

Tip: override the default fetch limit for an ad-hoc run with `--limit`, e.g. `--limit 5`.
If you installed with `pip install -e .`, you can omit the `PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src` prefix in the examples above.

### Logs
All runs are logged to `logs/goblin.log`.

## 🧩 Configuration

### Filters (`configs/filters.yaml`)
Control which titles, keywords, and locations Goblin includes or excludes.
You can also add optional salary gating, e.g.:
```
salary:
  min: 140000          # rejects jobs whose lower-bound salary is below this
  allow_missing: false # set true to keep jobs without a salary listed
```
Filters can be stored remotely in DynamoDB when `GOBLIN_FILTERS_TABLE` is set. Env vars:
- `GOBLIN_FILTERS_TABLE`: DynamoDB table name
- `GOBLIN_FILTERS_PK`: partition key name (default: `profile`)

### Ranking (`configs/ranking.yaml`)
Adjust the weight of keyword hits, title matches, remote bonuses, and penalties.

### Sources (`configs/sources.yaml`)
Enable or disable job sources and set default categories, limits, and queries.

### Scheduling
Slack command `schedule set <expr>` updates the EventBridge rule in `GOBLIN_SCHEDULE_RULE`.
Supply cron as `cron(...)` or plain 5/6-field cron (auto-wrapped). Requires IAM permissions for `events:DescribeRule` and `events:PutRule`.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

The test suite covers filtering logic, salary parsing, scoring/ranking, deduplication,
Slack block rendering, signature verification, command routing, profile resolution,
config loading, and schedule normalization — **162 tests**.

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes
- Requires **Python 3.10+** (developed on 3.12)
- Packaging via `pyproject.toml`; install with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- Uses `httpx`, `click`, `pyyaml`, `python-dotenv`, and `boto3`
- Logs and local caches are ignored via `.gitignore`

---

## ☁️ AWS Deployment
Goblin runs serverlessly on **AWS Lambda** with scheduling via **EventBridge**.
- **GitHub Actions** auto-deploys to Lambda on push to `main` (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **OIDC** authentication — no static AWS keys in CI
- **DynamoDB** stores per-profile filters and ranking weights
- **EventBridge** rules manage cron schedules, editable via Slack
- Secrets are injected as Lambda environment variables from GitHub Actions secrets
